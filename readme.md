# Arduino to .NET Serial Communication
This is a sample of how to use C# to read data from your Arduino (``Gemma M0``) via a USB Serial connection.

Here we're using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) instead of the Arduino IDE. Why? Because Platform.IO's integration with VS Code delivers a more superior experience pound-for-pound over the official Arduino IDE based off of Processing. 

## Components
* C#
* Arduino Gemma M0 from Adafruit
* USB connection
* PlatformIO with VS Code
